### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Joseph Beresheim, I am not too good at coding but I hope to achieve a better understanding and utilization of python and C through AerE 361. One of my hobbies include playing chess. I also enjoy spending time with my friends wether that being going out or jamming out with the handful of instruments we own.
